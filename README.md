# Portfolio Site

[View site](https://ka-node-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)

A gorgeous portfolio site using Static Node.js and Express to showcase the great projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page with contact info, an elevator pitch and information about me. A series of project pages showcase previous work and projects including: team-based application, a capstone project, random individual projects.

# static_portfolio

A gorgeous portfolio site using Static Node.js and Express to showcase the great projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page with contact info, an elevator pitch and information about me. A series of project pages showcase details of the first five projects completed in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

# Portfolio Site

[View site](https://ka-node-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)

A gorgeous portfolio site using Static Node.js and Express to showcase fun projects I've worked on and built over the past few years. The site includes a modern landing page, an about page with contact information, an elevator pitch, and information about me. A series of project pages showcase previous work and projects including: team-based projects, my capstone project for Lewis University, as well as independent projects.
